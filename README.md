This is more or less how I came up with the geoFormed Nhome. I keep an idea journal. This was a process of hundreds of ideas. Many long bike rides towing babies.

So I had an idea last year. Use the incredible cooling power of squash leaves to cool structures leveraging the stack effect. I'd planted squash around a teepee, and also felt how much it cooled hot concrete. 

But the some time passed and I moved to Langley from Tzfat. Too busy to get started.

Cloth covers for steel frame domes degrade quickly. 

What if we used a steel geodesic frame as a trellis to grow willow over the dome home making a greendome? And combine this with the squash and enhance using the strong stack effect of domed structures. Max cooling and totally free. 

I watch a video from pvc domes ( good stuff - functional, not aesthetic ), where they wrap a dome with screen and use Latex modified concrete ( LMC ) to form a super-thin shell dome for real cheap. Looks good. How could I make this better?

Downsides: It isn't flexible, it isn't insulated, it isn't finished, and it isn't up to code. These are the tough parts. Must find solutions.

Learn the all the relevant building codes. Read the builders handbook. Good enough. 

Research dome manufacuters. Now I understand the general challenges that come with existing types of dome structures. 

A solution must exist. I can feel it in my bones.

...

Go through design iterations.

...

Design is converging on a solution.

Click. Heck yeah. Found it. GeoForming.

Good. Maybe good enough.

Corrugated geoForming.

Ok. That was pretty strong. Good enough. 

Dendritic geoForming.

Hell yeah!

Carbon reinforced dendritic geoForming, formed using a reverse chicken wire geoForm.

Smash ideas together repeatedly.

Converged.

Now to make a full geoFormed shell prototype.

I'm excited.
