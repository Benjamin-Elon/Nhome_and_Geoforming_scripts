# Nhome_and_Geoforming_scripts

So I had an idea last year. Use the incredible cooling power of squash leaves to cool structures leveraging the stack effect. I'd planted squash around a teepee, and also felt how much it cooled hot concrete. 

But the some time passed and I moved to Langley from Tzfat. Too busy to get started.

What if we used a steel geodesic frame as a trellis to grow willow into a greendome? And combine this with the squash and enhance using the strong stack effect of domed structures. Max cooling and totally free. 

I watch a video from pvc domes ( good stuff - functional, not aesthetic ), where they wrap a dome with screen and use Latex modified concrete ( LMC ) to form a super-thin shell dome for real cheap. Looks good. How could I make this better?

Downsides: It isn't insulated, and it isn't finished, and it isn't up to code. These are the tough parts. Must find solutions.

Learn the all the relevant codes. Good enough. 

Research dome manufacuters. Now I understand the general challenges that come with existing types of dome structures. A solution must exist. I can feel it in my bones.

Go through design iterations.

Design is converging on a solution.
