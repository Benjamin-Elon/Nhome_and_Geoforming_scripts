I highly recommend keeping an idea journal to any person who enjoys creating. This was a process of hundreds of ideas, more than I could ever process without a process. Flow states are key for creativity and mandatory boredom is key to maximally creative flow states. Many long bike rides towing ye ole babies.

So I had an idea last year while setting up my plant nursery - use the incredible cooling power of squash leaves to cool structures, leveraging the stack effect. I previously planted squash around a teepee, and also felt how much those huge leaves cooled burning hot concrete. 

But the some time passed and I moved to Langley from Tzfat. Too busy to get started.

I like the idea of geodesic domes. So affordable and easy to set up. Downside: covers for steel frame domes degrade quickly and have low r-value. 

Idea: What if we used a steel geodesic frame as a trellis to grow willow over the dome home making a greendome, protecting from the elements? And combine this with the squash trick and enhance using the strong stack effect of domed structures. Max cooling and totally free. 

I want free heating too. And free compost. Wood chips release massive thermal energy. Apply tried and true composting tricks to produce a self-aerating, quick-start wood fuel cell for radiant heating. Chipdrop. Now it's free. Just scoop out your finished compost. There's a saying that a gardener can never have enough compost. Now; always too much compost. 10,000 dollars of compost is enough.

I watched a video from pvc domes ( good stuff - functional, not aesthetic ), where they wrap a dome with screen and use Latex modified concrete ( LMC ) to form a super-thin shell dome for real cheap. Looks ok. How could I make this better? 

Downsides: It isn't versatile, it isn't insulated, it isn't finished, and it isn't up to code. These are the tough parts. Must find solutions. I learn later that there are also issues with force transfer that make engineering difficult for most thinshell structures.

Learn the all the relevant building codes. Then, read the BC builders handbook. Good enough. Now I know exactly why houses are so expensive.

Research dome manufacuters. Now I understand the general challenges that come with existing types of dome structures. 

A solution must exist. I can feel it in my bones.

...

More design iterations.

...

Design is converging on a solution.

Click. Heck yeah. Found it.

GeoForming.

Good. Maybe good enough, but probably not.

Corrugated geoForming.

Ok. That was surprisingly strong in all the right ways. Good enough. 

Dendritic geoForming.

Hell yeah!

Smash ideas together repeatedly.

Converged.

A technique for manufacturing arbitrarily large, prefabricated, snap together geoform reinforcement sections, enabling simple, rapid manufactuing, easy transport and quick assembly using materials available anywhere.
